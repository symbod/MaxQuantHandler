Since MaxQuant can also be used to run several data collectively, it can also happen that results are provided with protein IDs of several organisms.

Additionally, decoy (REV_) and contaminants (CON_) IDs and/or unreviewed protein IDs can be removed.\n",

    "Suppose you want to compare data between organisms, for example if you want to do a review across several species, you come across a known problem. Gene names differ between species, making it necessary to map all IDs to a selected organism through an ortholog mapping.\n",

The selected gene name column is mapped to its orthologs based on target organism that has been specified. A dataframe including the mapped ortholog gene names and all other columns of the original data is returned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, depending on the original and target organism, there are more or less cases where no orthologous gene could be found. For a simplified overview of how many cases this was the case, this method can be used to obtain this information.\n",
